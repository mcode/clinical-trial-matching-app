Because there is\r\n             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to\r\n             treatment of the mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if\r\n             the mother is treated with olaparib or sapacitabine and for one month after receiving\r\n             the last dose.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants with known active Hepatitis B, C, or known HIV positive status.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants unable to swallow orally administered medication and participants with\r\n             gastrointestinal disorders that are likely to interfere with absorption of the study\r\n             medications in the opinion of the treating investigator (e.g. malabsorption syndrome\r\n             or major stomach or bowel resections).\r\n\r\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\r\n             composition to sapacitabine or olaparib.\r\n\r\n          -  Patients with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\r\n             or with features suggestive of MDS/AML.\r\n\r\n          -  History of a previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood\r\n             transplantation.\r\n\r\n          -  Patients with a history of a second primary malignancy, with the following exceptions:\r\n             adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancers, curatively treated in situ cancer of the\r\n             cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, stage 1 grade 1 endometrial\r\n             carcinoma, and any other solid tumor or lymphoma (without bone marrow involvement)\r\n             diagnosed ≥ 5 years prior to study entry and treated with no evidence of disease\r\n             recurrence; other exceptions may exist following agreement with the principal\r\n             investigator who believes disease recurrence is unlikely.\r\n\r\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\r\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac\r\n             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with\r\n             study requirements.\r\n\r\n          -  Participants who are involved in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to\r\n             both pharmaceutical company staff and/or staff at the study site).\r\n      "

In hormone positive breast cancer cells, blocking these proteins helps stop the cells from dividing to make new cells.

Women are\r\n             considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12\r\n             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.\r\n             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral\r\n             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.\r\n             In the case of bilateral oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the\r\n             woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not\r\n             of child bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:\r\n\r\n          -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the\r\n             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation\r\n             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\r\n\r\n          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without\r\n             hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking\r\n             study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of\r\n             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment\r\n\r\n          -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of\r\n             an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal\r\n             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone\r\n             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\r\n\r\n          -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill\r\n             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral\r\n             contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier method\r\n             of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.\r\n\r\n          -  For Arm A only: patients who have received prior fulvestrant.\r\n\r\n          -  For Arm C only: h/o of intolerable toxicity to CDK 4/6 inhibitor resulting in\r\n             treatment discontinuation due to toxicity\r\n      "

PARPs are proteins (made from genes which are part of DNA) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are involved in the repair of DNA. PARPs are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in DNA when cells divide. If the mistakes are not repaired, the defective cell will usually die and be replaced. Cells with mistakes in their DNA that do not die can become cancer cells.",
